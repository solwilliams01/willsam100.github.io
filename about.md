Hi,
My name is Sam if you haven't already guessed that.

This blog has three core purposes:
- technical education to help developers get or advance in their software job 
- technical education to help developers enjoy their job more (usually through reducing stress)
- to help me learn and formulate my ideas


**Bio**

My first introduction to programming was not a pleasant one. It was my final year in high school, and we were assigned the project to build a game. Many of my peers already knew how to program. One individual had been building some pretty cool looking Flash games (this was in the 00s). I had the joy of building Pong, only it turned to not be very joyous. The teacher did his best in helping, but I had zero-knowledge coding so felt like a burden as we were unable to communicate how to effectively write code. At the end of the project, I wanted nothing to do with coding and computers - I pursed management instead. 

I now work as a Tech Lead, writing software every day. I also help other team members on software related tasks. I have been writing software professionally for many years now and enjoy it immensely. Knowing that I have an 'in demand' set of skills is very comforting. It's is also very enjoyable solving hard problems, and even more enjoyable hearing positive feedback from users. 

I believe that it is possible to learn to write software, no matter what stage of life you are in. With some disciple and focused areas of study (university, Bootcamp or online courses), it is more than possible to acquiring the skills to be a professional software developer. 

Once a software job is achieved the next challenge arises. The day job of a developer can also be quite stressful or challenging in an unconstructive way. I believe this stress can be significantly mitigated with the right tools and practices. 

As stated above, the aim of this blog is to educate developers on effective tools and practices required for profession software position and to enhance the enjoyment of that position. 

Happy coding 
Sam
